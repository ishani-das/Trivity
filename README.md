# Trivity
Trivia for Charity app!

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for Trivity was to create a fun and entertaining way for people of all ages to learn about modern health and how the environment concerns our choices today. As a motivational source, a donation is made to charity based on correctly answered questions. 

## What it does
Trivity has five different categories of trivia, Medical Conditions, Environment, General Health, Food Wastage and Animal Cruelty/Veganism. The user can pick a category and answer a series of 10 true or false questions which will lead to a pop up message alerting the user of the donation made thanks to their contributions. 

## How I built it
We built Trivity using Swift in Xcode. 

## Challenges I ran into
It was hard to understand the logic on how to set up the project. At the beginning, we weren't sure how to set/link all the different pages together, and how to set a template page and edit that in the code.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
With our hard work along with help from the mentors, we made a fully-functioning app, and overcame many challenges and learned a lot more than we normally would in these past 24 hours!

## What I learned
We learned how to control Swift segue buttons along with their actions, and set up a template UIViewController which we later manipulated in the code to set to specific values stored in an array of questions.

## What's next for Trivity
The next step for Trivity is to redirect the user to their specific charity's website after clicking "Yes!" once they are done with the quiz. We would also like to implement a backend so users can store their progress and donations in their individual personal accounts.
